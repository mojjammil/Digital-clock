# Digital-clock
It all started as a class task.
<br/>
However while I was thinking about some hobby projects to show off on my portfolio, I decided to take this to the nexel level :boom:
<br/>
I hope to turn this into productivty dashboard page/chrome dashboard home page
<br/>
Expected features are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Spotify music player</li>
    <li>Favorite page reader in a glimpse without </li>
    <li>To-do list app</li>
    <li>Clock</li>
    <li>Weather info</li>
    <li>Option to switch background color or fetch daily wallpaper</li>
</ul>
